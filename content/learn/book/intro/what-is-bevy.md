Bevy is a modern, ECS-first game engine written in Rust. We aim to be:

- **Capable:** Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
- **Simple:** Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
- **Modular:** Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like
- **Fast:** App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
- **Productive:** Changes should compile quickly... waiting isn't fun
