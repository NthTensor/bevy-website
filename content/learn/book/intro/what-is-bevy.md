Bevy is a modern, ECS-first game engine written in Rust. We aim to be:

- **Capable:** Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set
- **Simple:** Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users
- **Modular:** Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like
- **Fast:** App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel
- **Productive:** Changes should compile quickly... waiting isn't fun

Bevy is [MIT](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/LICENSE-MIT) + [Apache v2](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/LICENSE-APACHE) licensed and controlled by the [Bevy Foundation](https://bevyengine.org/foundation/), a 501c3 charity run by the maintainers who do the day-to-day work to make Bevy what it is.
It's powered by hundreds of community contributors, and funded by the [generous donations](https://bevyengine.org/donate/) of the hobbyists and businesses that love and rely on it.
